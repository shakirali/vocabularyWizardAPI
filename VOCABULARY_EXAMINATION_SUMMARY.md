✅ "extremely small; so tiny it is barely visible" (48 chars)

❌ "complete or total" (19 chars)
✅ "complete and total, with no limits or exceptions" (50 chars)

❌ "sad and disappointed" (23 chars)
✅ "feeling sad and disappointed, especially after a setback" (57 chars)
```

**Impact:** Medium  
**Effort to Fix:** Moderate (15-20 hours for all)  
**Priority:** High (but not urgent)

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### **6 Words Need Urgent Fixes**

1. **CATEGORY** - Uses "categories" (plural) in example
2. **CREST-FALLEN** - Spelling inconsistency (crestfallen vs. crest-fallen)
3. **DAWDLE** - Uses "dawdling" instead of "dawdle" in example
4. **EXEMPLIFY** - Uses "exemplified" instead of "exemplify" in example
